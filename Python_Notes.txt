Python Notes:

Basic structure is read, evaluate, print loop or REPL

Leading white space is required in python.  Indent by 4 spaces for each level.  Colon is the sign that following line(s) must be indented


The zen of python:  call using "import this"

call modules using the import command

/ is float division (decimals)
// is integer division (whole numbers only)

** is exponent

int = whole number integer.  int() converts other types to int
float = decimal numbers.  Includes decimals or numbers using e.  float() converts other types to float
None = value indicating there is no value.  Stored as a blank value
bool = boolean type.  Values are True and False.  bool(0) = false bool(any other numerical value) = True


= is used to assign something to a variable

==  equal to
!=  not equal to
<   less than
>   greater than
<=  less than or equal to
>=  greater than or equal to


if, elif (else if), else


while loop:  while x is true do something.  otherwise, stop

ctrl + c terminates infinite loops in python


input() = ask for user input in console


str = string type.  sequence of text.  Once a string is created, it can't be changed.  You can use both "" or ''
      You can automatically concatenate by putting strings next to each other in quotes.  \n = new line
      r in front of a string creates a raw string not using escape characters

bytes = sequences of bytes.  Used for raw binary data.  prefix is b

list = sequence of objects.  Can change objects within a list.  [1, 2, 3] is a list of 1 2 and 3.  Can contain multiple
       types (int, str, bool, etc).  use [] to create a blank list

dictionaries = key:value pair.  Used in {}  {k1: v1, k2: v2}

def func_name(x):
    return x * x

Local Scope = variables defined inside the current function
Enclosing Scope = variables defined inside and and all enclosing functions
Global Scope = variables defined at the top level of the module
Built-in Scope = variables defined by the builtins module of python

Scope is checked from narrowes (Local) to widest (Built-in)

tuple = similar to lists.  Set up in parentheses.  Items separated by commas.  Can access elements with 0 based index.      Immutable.
